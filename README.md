# Crypto Chicken Run
With crypto chicken run you can never be bored. With a flawless blockchain and NFT integration, I have created a game that can be played by anyone, and then you can earn NFTs to upgrade your character with perks. Have an integrated burning mechanism in the game to create gamification of the characters. 

# How it's made
It is made using the Alchemy, Polygon, Moralis, and IPFS, NFT-Port, covalent, TableLand in the tech stack. I have used express as backend and simple HTML js and three.js in the frontend. Stored the blockchain data like scores and perks on Tableland. I have also used Sequence wallet as well as Moralis to give users an option to connect to the blockchain.
